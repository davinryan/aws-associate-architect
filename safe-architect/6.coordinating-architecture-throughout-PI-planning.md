# Co-ordinating architecture throughout PI planning

## Role of architect
* present architectural vision
* elaborate on NFRs
* ensure consistency of architecture across teams
* Support ROAM (resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated) activity by identifying and/or owning program risks (not team risks - teams handle these)
* Partner with guide and mentor Agile teams (to reinforce architectural direction)
* circulate amongst teams and collaborate to answer questions  

## Contribute to PI planning
Talk about / communicate and zero in on
* architectural themes (vision and practices)
* NFRs
* Enablers
* identity/anticipate dependencies between ARTs and suppliers
* consider what becomes a committed vs uncommitted objective
* defend architectural approaches citing business consequences if not implemented

**Cool notes**
* Respect decision urgency - decide in ways that teach
* Strive for shared clarity - draw on the spot diagrams
* Defer decisions until the last possible moment
* Limit architectural WIP - Don't be a bottleneck
* Partner with system (platform) team as they mostly work with enablers
* How to deal with risk
  * What may be constraining the team - capacity knowledge
  * What is the 'real' business impact of the risk to get perspective
  * What tradeoffs can be made in order to mitigate the risk

## Contribute to management review and problem-solving
**Common questions at the end of day one of PI planning**
* what did we learn
* what adjustments need to be made to vision, scope
* are there any bottlenecks
* solution viable over long term
* balance of business and architectural objectives
* what decisions required to close gap

Note: Above is done via program management review and problem-solving. In Large SAFE this is called 
Solution train management review and problem-solving

**Cool notes**
* Architects should be ready to step into implementation work and swarm with other teams when necessary.

## Contribute to solution post-PI planning
Booorrring.. this is very un-inspired. It's basically another session to finish off the previous

**Goals**
* understand the PI plan for solution
* make adjustments as required to ARTs

**Inputs**
* Program PI objectives from all ARTS
* Solution train board
* Solution risks

**Outcomes**
* SMART solution PI objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely)
* Updated solution board
* commitment on changes based on confidence vote
