# Co-ordinating architecture throughout PI planning

## The real deal
* Solution boards are aggregates of ART boards, they should invent nothing!!
* ART and solution boards have
  * milestones e.g. anticipated delivery dates
  * risks
  * objectives (committed/uncommitted)
* Objectives should be SMART - Specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely

## Role of architect
* act as a facilitator
* present architectural vision
* elaborate on NFRs
* synchronise
  * ensure consistency of architecture across teams
  * circulate amongst teams and collaborate to answer questions
* resolve issues
  * Support ROAM (resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated) activity by identifying and/or owning ART risks (not team risks - teams handle these)
  * keep dependencies in check
* engaged - Partner with, guide and mentor Agile teams (to reinforce architectural direction)

## Contribute to PI planning
Talk about / communicate and zero in on ... everything ... sigh... specifically anything that impacts enablers, NFRs
* architectural themes (vision and practices)
* NFRs
* Enablers
* identity/anticipate dependencies between ARTs and suppliers
* consider what becomes a committed vs uncommitted objective
* defend architectural approaches citing business consequences if not implemented

**Cool notes**
* Respect decision urgency - decide in ways that teach
* Strive for shared clarity - draw on the spot diagrams
* Defer decisions until the last possible moment
* Limit architectural WIP - Don't be a bottleneck
* Partner with system (platform) team as they mostly work with enablers
* How to deal with risk
  * What may be constraining the team - capacity, knowledge
  * What is the 'real' business impact of the risk to get perspective
  * What tradeoffs can be made in order to mitigate the risk

## Contribute to management review and problem-solving
**Common questions at the end of day one of PI planning**
* what did we learn
* contribute to ROAMing risks
  * what decisions required to close gap
  * solution viable over long term
  * are there any bottlenecks
  * what adjustments need to be made to vision, scope
  * balance of business and architectural objectives

Note: Above is done via value management review and problem-solving. In Large SAFE this is called 
Solution train management review and problem-solving ... big surprise...

**Cool notes**
* Architects should be ready to step into implementation work and swarm with other teams when necessary.
* In the case of a ROAMed risk about lack of team capacity - System architects should be prepared to join a team 
clear their capacity and pair with the team for implementation - creates empathy for the team

## Contribute to solution post-PI planning
Booorrring.. this is very un-inspired. It's basically another session to finish off the previous with the same outputs
but one level higher if you have a large solution

**Goals**
* understand the PI plan for solution
* make adjustments as required and communicate to ARTs

**Inputs**
* Program PI objectives from all ARTS
* Solution train board
* Solution risks

**Outcomes**
* SMART solution PI objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely)
* Updated solution planning board
* commitment on changes based on confidence vote
