# Supporting New Strategic Themes and Value Streams

## Role of EA architect
Essentially bridge business and technology strategy
* Engagement: portfolio activities
* champion and communicate strategic themes by owning Enabler Epics
* strongly influence portfolio budgets
* provide high level vision via Lean portfolio management (LPM)
* balance business and technology strategy in portfolios
* Strategic items responsible for
  * Choice of technology and usage - e.g. pick the right CMS
  * Solution architecture strategy - e.g. align solution/system architects
  * Infrastructure strategy        - cloud, infra as code, make it go unnoticed 
  * Inter-ART collaboration    - e.g. re-use between teams, but maintain freedom to keep innovation high 
  * Implementation strategy        - e.g. iterative building of software

## Align architecture to Enterprise strategy
**mostly engaged in LPM**
(first two) 
  1. strategy and investment funding (portfolio aligned and funded to create and maintain solutions needed to meet business targets)
  2. Lean Governance (manages spending, audit and compliance, forecasting expenses, and measurement)
  3. (NOT) Agile Portfolio Operations (Agile portfolio operations coordinate and support decentralized program execution, enabling operational excellence)

**Process**
1. Update strategic themes and value streams
2. Update portfolio vision
3. Update NFRs in Solution Intent

Example: Globalzon takes on front end activities
1. Update strategic theme and value streams - add Globalzon expansion strategy to list
2. Update portfolio vision to accommodate: _Our best-in-class autonomous delivery solution will enable TTC to experience rapid
revenue growth in the commercial sector through the Globalzon partnership , as well as continued global expansion via
a highly scalable , multi-tenant deployment model._
3. Update NFRs - add more scalability, add multi-tenancy, add more availability

## Evolve the Solution Portfolio
Essentially: rationalisation
* Deal with issues like "In the context of TTC, how will we fund this new value stream? How will that impact
other areas?"
* Spikes in new trends
* Minimise tech duplication (shadow IT)
* Minimise tech licensing and support costs
* Manage tech portfolio through mergers and acquisitions

**Use Investment horizons**
to manage obsolescence and technical debt. Almost like a warbly map but for the birth -> retirement of
software

EA's maintain the right percentage of investment in the following for a solution's lifecycle
* Evaluating
* Emerging
* Investing
* Extracting
* Retiring

**Cool facts**
* lifecycles of software systems are getting shorter, so we need to get better at automation to stay ahead

## Contribute Enabler Epics to the Portfolio Kanban
* Enabler Epics require Lean business cases
* EA's own enabler epics here
* Foster innovation with the lean start-up cycle
  1. Each Epic has an outcome hypothesis
  2. Defines MVP
  3. Hypothesis proven (passes MVP)
  4. Yes - Dev continues
  5. No - Pivot?
* (Above start-up cycle but using Kanban) - Govern Epic flow with portfolio kanban system
  1. Funnel            - All big ideas welcome
  2. Reviewing         - WSJF, WIP limited, hypothesis created
  3. Analysing         - alternatives, cost estimate, lean business case, go/no-go decision
  4. Ready             - approved by LPM team, WSJF routinely applied
  5. Implementing      - Create Program Epics, capabilities and features
  6. Done              - Hypothesis checked OR Pivot
  * Why - visibility, structure, avoid unrealistic expectations, collaboration etc...
* Use architecture GAP analysis using similarities and differences to figure out Epic enablers

**Cool facts**
* use Epic owners to own and manage one or two epics at a time during stages 1 - 4, 6 (kanban thing)
* Epics don't have acceptance criteria or end state but focus on optimum economic benefit achieved
* Epics don't have a definition of done but 'done enough'

**Epic example**
1. Hypothesis Statement
For:           Apple systems
who:           would like to pass information between each other
the:           Apple ID
is a:          unique user identifier
that:          is recognizable across all systems.
Unlike:        user IDs that exist in each separate system
our solution:  will provide the ability to recognize an Apple user across the entire ecosystem

2. Business outcome
  * Upsell and cross-sell due to functionality that crosses the eco-system
  * Lower attrition rates
3. Leading indicators
  * Developers internally use the feature to offer cross-system features
  * Features enabled by Apple ID receive high reviews
4. NFRs
  * Security and encryption considerations

**Epics - lean business case**
Epics represent significant investments in money and time, so they require justification. Use a form to 
answer the following (Lean business case template) :
* 'Just the right amount' of analysis
* Avoid over-specificity
* Define the outcomes' hypothesis (see above)
* Understand implementation impact
* Develop incremental implementation strategy
* Gain approval

** Lean business case** 
Essentially has these main sections
* Name, description, owner, funnel entry date
* Business Hypothesis, Leading indicators, NFRs 
* In/out of scope, MVP
* Future or opportunity features/capabilities
* Sponsors, users markets affected
* Impacts on products, programs and services

## Coordinate across Value Streams
Not great clear details here but whatever...

Essentially EA works with following to Sync value streams
* Lean portfolio management          - portfolio -> set of solutions
* AVMO (Agile value management office) - support decentralised efficient program execution
essentially keep value streams in sync and enable teams to do the agile thing

**Goals**
* work across value streams: minimise impact of cross-cutting dependencies
* tech guidance, evolution of tech, larger NFRs for portfolio solution set (security, compliance, performance etc...)

**Good questions for EAs to sync value streams**
* what systems are shared, integrated and how might they evolve over time
* Example answer, TTC Vehicles are common to all VS's, reduce inter-dependencies with separate tech stacks
via multi-tenancy, microservices to keep redundancy and technical debt down

## Questions from the word soup
* what is lean agile - ability to scale agile for enterprise essentially and reduce waste. Comes from lean manufacturing
* what are agile architectural values
  * emergent over intentional design
  * avoid being a road block
  * continuous flow
  * balance business features vs enablers
