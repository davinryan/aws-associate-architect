# Aligning architecture with business value

## Know, understand and challenge things outside your control
Reference: https://www.scaledagileframework.com/lean-portfolio-management/
* Understand read and question these things to hell and back before even having conversations about the next PI
  * Strategic Themes/goals
  * Porfolio Canvas
  * Porfolio Vision
* Hold to account Lean Portfolio management team (like a news reporter, hold to account those who have most of the power)
  * Strategy and investment funding (enterprise executives, Business owners, Enterprise Architect) e.g.
    * Definition: Strategy and investment funding ensures that the entire portfolio is aligned and funded to create and maintain the solutions needed to meet business targets
    * advocate for capacity allocation especially if the project calls for it e.g. re*platforming
    * demand data/metrics (OKR level) in strategic goals and lean business cases
    * demand honesty about priority and relevance of all strategic themes/goals 
  * Lean governance (agile program management office (APMO), enterprise architect, Business owners) e.g.
    * Definition: Lean Governance manages spending, audit and compliance, forecasting expenses and measurement
    * demand and participate in use of and quality of outcome/competency metrics
  * Agile portfolio operations (APMO, RTE, solution management (SM), communities of practice (CoP))
    * Definition: Agile portfolio operations coordinate and support decentralized program execution, enabling operational excellence
    * demand and participate in use of and quality of flow metrics

## Be careful with metrics
* use measurement in conjunction with other discovery tools
* apply metrics where they support improved decision-making
* understand the effect of metrics on behaviour
* interpret metrics carefully

# Preparing architecture for PI planning

## Relentlessly pursue things under your control
* Owner enabler epics and features. Play a major part in
  * writing them
  * managing/stakeholder for LBC
  * creating features
  * testing/checking business hypothesis - be responsible for reviewing and holding up business hypothesis of enablers to prove progress
  * assigning to teams
  * create acceptance criteria
  * prioritise - WSJF - contribute mostly to 'risk reduction and/or opportunity enablement' aspect
  * define NFRs - realised by enablers
  * identify measurable benefits and metrics
  * demoing them during system and solution demos
  * own that capacity allocation, fight for it
* Alignment - Make sure architects are aligned and if not then relentless sort this out before doing anything else otherwise you're wasting your time
* Metrics - demand and participate in use of and quality of flow metrics at the team level
* Keep features and related material as high level as possible to support low level changes
* Architect tips
  * aim to have a home team. It just simplifies everything
    * aim to calculate capacity and load
  * specialise over generalising even sprint by sprint - to help with cognitive overload is system sophisticated enough
  * if home team not possible then stay with a team even for a sprint or two but manage capacity and load from architecture team
