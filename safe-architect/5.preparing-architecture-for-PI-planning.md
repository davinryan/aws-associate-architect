# Preparing architecture for PI planning

## Contributing to program backlog
Enablers are at every level

**EPIC**
Container for a solution development initiative to define an MVP
* Applied: SAFE Portfolio
* Backlog: Portfolio backlog
* Span: multiple PIS
* Owned: Lean portfolio management
* Prioritised: using WSJF (weighted shortest job first)
* Do not have acceptance criteria, instead have hypothesis statement and 'done enough' or
optimum economic benefit achieved

**Capabilities**
Higher-level Solution behavior that typically spans multiple ARTs
* Applied: SAFE Large solution
* Backlog: Solution backlog
* Span: single PI
* Owned: Solution management
* Prioritised: using WSJF (weighted shortest job first)

**Feature**
Benefit hypothesis and acceptance criteria
* Applied: All SAFE
* Backlog: program backlog
* Span: single PI
* Owned: ART
* Prioritised: using WSJF (weighted shortest job first)

**Enablers**
Support activity need to extend architectural runway to enable faster feature development or at all
* Applied: All SAFE
* Backlog: All
* Span: iteration -> multiple PIs
* Owned: Architects (mostly)
* Types: exploration(spikes), infrastructure, compliance and architectural (general I guess??)
* structure
```text
Enabler Feature name    - A short phrase providing name and context
Enabler description     - Briefly describe the Enabler
Benefit hypothesis      - Proposed measurable benefit to the end-user or business
Acceptance criteria     - Determines whether the implementation is correct and delivers the proposed business benefits
```

**NFRs**
Initially realised by enablers. These are fixed things that define something. Enablers are 'lets do this and see'
* Backlog: none (they are more like acceptance criteria)

### Role of architects

**Features & Capabilities**
* help with acceptance criteria
* prioritisation
* Define NFRs
* Identify architectural impact
* Identify measurable benefits and metrics -- ?? really!!

My experience - ultimately defining NFRs, keeping acceptance criteria ontrack with existing architectural runway 
and prioritisation of architectural concerns

## Sequence and prioritise work in program backlog
**WSJF**
WSJF provides a model to reason about priorities and align stakeholders to the best economic outcomes
* give priority to shorter pieces of work with the highest cost of delay = WSJF = cost of delay / job size
* ignores sunk costs 
* and helps to decentralise decision-making and control with rules
* Cost of delay 
  * business value
  * time criticality
  * risk reduction and/or opportunity enablement (e.g. enable other work down the track or inhibit it)

**Capacity Allocation**
In low trust or immature environments you can use this. Set rules for capacity for 
* new features
* enablers
* tech debt and maintenance

### Role of architects
Essentially identify areas where backlog does not reflect right balance of work to support business outcomes now and 
in the future
* negotiate capacity allocation
* use WSJF to get enablers and NFRS prioritised

## Contribute to solution pre PI planning
* Goals: Align everyone to the solution vision
* Inputs: previous PI results (demos)
* Outputs: Set of features for every ART, updates to ART Visions, Risks

### Role of architects
Participate during 'Business context and solution vision briefing' with architectural vision briefing
* describe/understand the solution runway to achieve solution vision
* create enablers required to build solution runway this PI in key backlogs
* manage dependencies across teams
* understand impact of solution context and NFRs and how they 'constrain' the solution

Architects need to be able to get their ideas into the appropriate backlogs and prioritized alongside other work. 
Assume no one else is going to do it. If it doesn't happen, important architectural decisions will likely be lost 
and trumped by the work that is in the backlog
