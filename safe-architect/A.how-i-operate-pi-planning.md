# Tips and tricks
* ALWAYS ALWAYS associate architecture work with a piece of implementation work in another team - Have a design story that gets consumed by an implementation story
* Get comfortable coding, reviewing code and acting like a team member. If you can't code.... LEARN! Its not hard
* Foster lean agile-mindset (growth mindset) - https://www.scaledagileframework.com/lean-agile-mindset/
* Embody SAFe house of lean values
  * Respect for people and culture (generative culture) 
  * Flow (projects to products)
  * Innovation (pivot without mercy or guilt)
  * Relentless improvement (constant sense of danger)
* architects need to stay visible and accessible not just govern! Otherwise, how can they participate
  in variable solution intent
* Core customer is teams
* Lead by example, be an ART team's champion
* Always, always ask "IS THE ARCHITECTURE ENABLING OR HINDERING FEATURE DELIVERY"
* If you canâ€™t pull off the system demo, you have false velocity. It is the indicator that the ART is,
  or is not, practicing Agile at scale.
* Architects should be ready to step into implementation work and swarm with other teams when necessary
* Respect decision urgency - decide in ways that teach
* Strive for shared clarity - draw on the spot diagrams
* Defer decisions until the last possible moment
* Limit architectural WIP - Don't be a bottleneck
* Partner with system (platform) team as they mostly work with enablers
* How to deal with risk
  * What may be constraining the team - capacity, knowledge
  * What is the 'real' business impact of the risk to get perspective
  * What tradeoffs can be made in order to mitigate the risk
* **Coach like an Agilest** - Develop skills in
  * Consultancy     - developer frameworks
  * Coach           - create shared goals
  * Counselor       - develop structure to resolve dysfunction
  * Change Agent    - focus on embedded change
  * Facilitator     - support a formal outcome without advice
  * Lean Leader     - life-long learning focus on Kaizen
  * Teacher/Trainer - Focus on skills' development through instruction
  * Mentor          - Develop a 'how to'

# Contribute to PI planning
* Present architectural vision to the field and the teams
* Use set-based design, spikes to elaborate options
* Elaborate on
  * NFRs
  * Enabler features
  * Dependencies - identity/anticipate dependencies between teams and suppliers, dependencies are a red flag
* Engage and Synchronise teams
  * work from common architectural principles that achieve strategic goals/themes/vision
  * ensure consistency of architecture across teams - do ad hoc architecture diagrams - these can be part of the emergent architecture
  * circulate amongst teams and collaborate to answer questions
  * Partner with, guide and mentor Agile teams (to reinforce architectural direction)
  * Talk about / communicate and zero in on anything that impacts enablers, NFRs
  * Promote architectural themes (vision and practices)
  * consider what becomes a committed vs uncommitted objective
  * defend architectural approaches citing business consequences if not implemented
* Resolve issues
  * Support ROAM (resolved, owned, accepted, mitigated) activity by identifying and/or owning program risks (not team risks - teams handle these)
  * keep dependencies in check

# Contribute during sprints

* follow SAFE principles and values

## During PI and System demo
* Refining architectural backlog
* Shepherding architectural vision all through implementation (verify alignment with solution intent)
* Refactor architecture (gather feedback, gauge value of decisions, observe emergent architecture)
* Improving CI/CD tools
* Deliver minimum viable architecture (MVA)
* Research trends and apply emerging technology

## During System demo (End of PI)
* Architects are team members who demo their work (architectural runway - spikes, enablers, NFRs etc...)
* They should attend other teams iteration/system demos
* Verify alignment with solution intent (gather feedback, gauge value of decisions, observe emergent architecture)
* prepare capabilities
* Demo enablers, capabilities, NFRs, benefits
* Provide feedback on implemented solution
* Requires strong DevOps practices being in place due to heavy integration across teams work

# Contribute to management review and problem-solving
* use inspect and adapt. Don't rely on organisation to do this, do it yourself
**Common questions at the end of day one of PI planning**
Note: Done via program management review and problem-solving. In Large SAFE this is called
Solution train management review and problem-solving
* what did we learn
* what adjustments need to be made to vision, scope
* are there any bottlenecks
* solution viable over long term
* balance of business and architectural objectives
* what decisions required to close gap

## Contribute to solution post-PI planning
**Goals**
* understand the PI plan for solution
* make adjustments as required and communicate to ARTs

**Inputs**
* Program PI objectives from all ARTS
* Solution train board
* Solution risks

**Outcomes**
* SMART solution PI objectives (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, timely)
* Updated solution planning board
* commitment on changes based on confidence vote
