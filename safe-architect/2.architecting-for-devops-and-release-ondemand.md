# Architecting for DevOps and release on-demand

## Role of Architect
* architect for flow by using enablers
* Identify enablers with value stream mapping
* participate in CI/CD
* bridge comms between business dev and operations (break the walls!)
* automate architectural compliance checks (like stopping distance in car)
* Evangelize CALMR
* Use DevOps health radar to communicate progress
* Major improvements
  * MVA
  * automate compliance checks
  * continuous collaboration
  * loosely coupled systems
  * architecture as code
  * federated architecture

## Foster a DevOps culture
**CALMR approach**
* Culture - shared responsibility for dev, deploy, operations
* Automation - CI/CD
* Lean Flow - small batch sizes, limit WIP, extreme visibility
* Measurement - measure flow (flow metrics), full stack telemetry (observability)
* Recovery - enable low risk releases (small batch right!) fast rollback or fast fix-forward

## Describe how value flows through the continuous delivery pipeline (CDP)
**DevOps health radar** - very very cool comms device for maturity
* 4 quadrants
  * continuous exploration (alignment) - hypothesize, collaborate & research, architect, synthesize
  * continuous integration (quality) - stage, test end-to-end build, develop
  * continuous deployment (speed) - respond, monitor, verify, deploy
  * release on-demand (value) - release, stabilize, measure, learn

**(Development (as apposed to Operational)) Value stream mapping**
* visualise steps in end-to-end delivery process
* understand how value flows through organisation
* measure delivery efficiency and identify bottlenecks with LT, PT and %C&A (complete and accurate)
* locate real root causes of delivery problems
* define and prioritise process improvements

Example
* identify phases in value e.g. plan, architect/design, code/integrate, test, deploy, warrenty/fix
* apply
  * Lead time - time before worked on
  * process time - worked on time
  * percent complete & accurate - % usable as-is by owners of next activity)
  * activity ratio - PT / LT -> (% of total lead time attributable to value-add activities)

## Radar - Architect for and facilitate continuous exploration (innovation)
* align MMF (minimum marketable features) to make MVP
* architect for fast business outcomes
* define architectural runway
* define MVA
* DDD
* NFRs

## Radar - Architect for continuous integration (quality)
* Automate
  * integration, testing, deployment, compliance
* integration - loosely coupled systems, trunk based development
* testing - rapid testing with mocks and test data generators
* deployment - chatOps, CI/CD
* compliance - static code analysis, vulnerability scanning, requirements and change traceability

## Radar - Architect for continuous deployment (speed)
* continuous deployment (CD)
* de-couple deployment from release <- super important!!!
* Full stack telemetry (observability)
* Rapid recovery from prod issues (low MTTR)
* Key values
  * on-click deploys
  * infra as code
  * self-service
* recoverability
  * auto rollback
  * rapid fix-forward
  * immutable infrastructure <- very important!!
  * Chaos monkey testing

## Radar - Architect for release on-demand (value)
* Key values
  * de-couple release elements e.g feature flags
  * architect for operations (NFRs)
    * Intrusion detection
    * full stack monitoring and logging
    * pro-active issue detection and notification <- very important!!
    * failover to support Chaos monkey
  * measure business value delivered (very hard)
    * BI dashboards / reports
    * UX analytics
    * System analytics
    * Retros and Inspect & Adapt sessions
* 3 questions test - if yes to all then you can deploy - avoid change approval boards
* Design for SLOs, BCP, QoS
