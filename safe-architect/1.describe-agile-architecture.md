# Exemplifying Agile Architecture

## Role of architect
* maintain traceability and alignment. Architect is a role not a position. So architects can be engineers

## Describe agile architecture
* Evolves (emergent)
* Avoids overheads/delays (relentless improvement)
* Running software (demos)
* Continuous flow of value (Flow metrics, remove bottlenecks)
* Balance intentional and emergent design

## Describe SAFe architect roles and collaborations
* Enterprise Architect
  * Main: align business and technology
  * Across: value streams (sync ARTs)
  * strategic direction
* Solutions Architect
  * Main: Plans architecture runway for full solution - more than one ART
  * Across: more than one system
  * Essentially supports system architects who do all the work
* Systems Architect
  * Main: Plans architecture runway - one ART
  * Across: single system
  * Elaborates Epics, Capabilities, Business Capabilities

### Enterprise Architect
* Aligning business and technical strategies
* Establishing the portfolios intentional architecture
* Rationalising technology portfolio
* Fostering innovative ideas and technologies by 
* Guiding enabler epics

### Solution Architect
* Implementing lean systems engineering
* Establishing solution intent and context
* Defining and communicating architecture vision
* Evolving solution architecture with ARTs and Suppliers
* Fostering built-in quality and CD
* Evolving live solutions

### System Architect
* Aligning architecture with business priorities
* Defining and communicating architecture vision (...same as solution architect... ok...)
* Evolving system design with teams
* Fostering built-in quality and attending to NFRs
* Supporting DevOps and CD

**Architecture domains to be across**
Don't have to be an expert but must be able to operate across. 
Fun game to identify an architect type - see what they tick yes to
* business architecture (enterprise)
  * WHAT: how the business vision impacts value streams
  * FOCUS: how the business will evolve to meet strategic objectives
* information architecture  (enterprise, solution)
  * WHAT: captured and maintained business data 
  * FOCUS: how information is stored and supports business
* security architecture (solution, system)
  * WHAT: support for business policies, protecting the business from breeches or attacks 
  * FOCUS: balance of keeping the business safe while providing the best experience to customers and an efficient working environment for engineers 
* integration architecture (solution system)
  * WHAT: common services, APIs and messaging protocols
  * FOCUS: how applications interact
* technical architecture (system)
  * WHAT: Hardware, networks, systems that support applications and data
  * FOCUS: evolution of infrastructure to align with business needs
* application architecture (system)
  * WHAT: how customers consume services directly
  * FOCUS: how the customer experiences the system and managing evolution of design technical debt to balance valud and cost

**Cool facts**
how can you decentralise decision-making - do the 3 big questions. If you answer yes then you can
