In addition to System Architects, what is the best role to define and maintain Planning Interval (PI) Roadmaps?

What is true about Lean Budget Guardrails?



In balancing intentional architecture and emergent design for the upcoming Planning Interval (PI), what three things does a System Architect work to avoid? (Choose three.)
Explaining the architectural Vision to AgileTeams
Untested nonfunctional requirements (NFRs)
Unvalidated architectural decisions
Excessive redesign
Reuse of common components
Sacrificing the immediate needs of users


An Agile Release Train (ART) is defining new Architectural Runway for a future Planning Interval (PI). A senior developer approaches the System Architect with concerns that the developers do not have the knowledge to implement the Enablers.
How should the Architect help to resolve this?
Hire contractors to implement the Enablers
Start involving the developers in Architectural Runway planning
Encourage the developers to devote non-work hours to gain the knowledge
Develop detailed design specifications that clarify the development tasks


The System Architects are working with the Product Managers to prepare the Agile Release Train for Planning Interval (PI) Planning. What three activities will the Architects be working on? (Choose three.)You have reached the max number of allowed answers
Team training
ROAMing risks
Enabler elaboration
ART backlog elaboration
Capacity allocation percentages
Agile project management tooling


Which three roles and/or functions coordinate across Value Streams? (Choose three.)You have reached the max number of allowed answers
Product Managers
Solution Architects
Solution Portfolio Management
Release Train Engineers
Agile value management office (AVMO)
Enterprise Architects


What do Strategic Themes provide input to?
Pre-PI Planning
Team Backlogs
Requirements
Customer segments and revenue streams

Which is considered an Agile architecture practice?
Allow Feature decomposition
Allow a system to always run
Support architectural review boards
Manage stage gates


What part of the House of Lean is related to the coaching role of an Architect?
Individuals and interactions
Organize around value
Lean-Agile Leadership
Relentless improvement

On which Agile Manifesto principle is Agile architecture primarily based?
The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
Simplicity is essential
Welcome changing requirements even when late in the development phase

With whom should the System Architect collaborate on the Planning Interval (PI) Roadmap to align and guide teams toward a shared technical Vision?
Release Train Engineer and Product Owners
Enterprise Architect and Product Management
Scrum Masters and the Release Train Engineer
Business Owners and Product Owners

What is an Architect's primary responsibility during management review and problem-solving?
Adjust the Planning Interval (PI) Roadmap
Create new Enabler Stories
De-scope Enabler Features
Evaluate and adjust the architecture Vision

What is considered taking an economic view in architecture?
Facilitating System and Solution Demos
Performing return on investment (ROI) analysis on every Enabler
Supporting emergent design
Architecting for desired business outcomes

What is one of the key outcomes from Solution pre-PI Planning?
Defining Solution Capabilities
Determining Solution Content
Matching Solution demand to ART capacities
Updating Solution Intent

What is included in a development value stream?
Design and build
Release and design
Release and timelines
Define and test

What is an outcome of post-Planning Interval (PI) Planning?
An updated Solution Roadmap
PI Objectives for each Agile Release Train (ART)
A finished program board
PI Objectives for the Solution Train


What are two benefits of a Solution Roadmap? (Choose two.)You have reached the max number of allowed answers
Provides stakeholders a set of committed deliverables over a multi-year timeframe
Allows internal stakeholders time needed to align with the development organization
Gains commitment from the Agile Release Trains (ARTs) on when Enabler Features will be delivered
Customers, Suppliers, and partners understand how Solutions will evolve and participate in achieving the Vision
Shows stakeholders what Features are forecast for the next three Planning Intervals (PIs)


What is an anti-pattern regarding an attribute of Agile architecture?
Architects realize business objectives by translating strategy from strategic themes into solutions
Focuses on systems and applications used directly by the end users
Used together, emergent design and intentionality continuously build and extend the architectural runway
To support continuous deployment, Agile architecture decouples deployment from release

In addition to Solution Train Engineers and Solution Architects, who of the following should regularly attend Solution pre- and post-Planning Interval (PI) Planning?
Agile Teams
Suppliers
Epic Owners
Enterprise Architects
