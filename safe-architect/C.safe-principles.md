1. Take an economic view
   * economics should inform and drive decisions
   * Deliver early and often
   * Apply an economic framework: guardrails, lean budgets, WSJF
2. Apply systems thinking
   * consider entire system 
   * theory of constraints
3. Assume variability, preserve options
   * Set-based design (survival of fittest option)
4. Build incrementally with fast, integrated learning cycles
   * PDCA
   * integrate often
   * customer feedback
5. Base milestones on objective evaluation of working systems
   * Demos
   * feedback loops
6. Make value flow without interruptions 
   * Flow metrics 
   * Visualise and limit WIP
   * address bottlenecks
   * minimise hand-offs and dependencies
   * get faster feedback
   * work in smaller batches
   * reduce queue length
   * optimise time in the zone
   * remediate legacy policies and practices
7. Apply cadence, synchronize with cross-domain planning
   * PI planning and other ceremonies
8. Unlock the intrinsic motivation of knowledge workers
   * Nurture autonomy
     * lead with objectives not tasks
     * Decentralise decision-making
     * Allocate time for self-directed exploratory work
     * Organise around value (inverse conways law)
   * Cultivate mastery
     * Engage in challenging activities, foster learning from errors
     * Leverage unexpected rewards
     * Built-in quality
     * Optimise time for 'in the zone'
     * Special assignments - develop new or existing skills
     * Providing learning opportunities
   * Proving Purpose
     * Connect with customer
     * Provide mission and vision
     * Bridge work to outcomes
     * Leverage synergistic goal setting
     * Recognise the team as a unit
9. Decentralize decision-making - centralise strategic decisions, de-centralise everything else
10. Organize around value
    * Build tech portfolios and development value streams
    * Realize value streams with product-focused ARTs
    * Form Agile teams that can directly deliver value
