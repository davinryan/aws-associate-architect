# Leading as an Architect during a Lean-Agile Transformation

## Role as Architect
* Architects are powerful leaders. They have
  * influence
  * closer to work than mangers and execs
* Should be members or synchronise with the LACE often

## Describe how Architects perform as Lean-Agile leaders
* enable knowledge workers - de-centralise decision making
  * lead by example - embody the values below and others might copy them
  * this drives towards a lean agile mindset
* Values
  * House of agile Pillar values (Comes from Lean)
    * Respect for people and culture
    * Flow
    * Innovation
    * Relentless improvement
  * SAFE values (not as good as above)
    * respect for people
    * relentless improvement
    * alignment - lesson 8
    * transparency - interesting...boards and other information radiators
* Read some books

**Coach like an Agilest**
Develop skills in 
* Consultancy     - developer frameworks
* Coach           - create shared goals
* Counselor       - develop structure to resolve dysfunction
* Change Agent    - focus on embedded change
* Facilitator     - support a formal outcome without advice
* Lean Leader     - life-long learning focus on Kaizen
* Teacher/Trainer - Focus on skills' development through instruction
* Mentor          - Develop a 'how to'

## Describe how to lead the transition to Agile architecture during a transformation
* Green fields - adapt to a reverse conways law, make your architecture and form your teams around it and then evolve the
architecture and team structures together
* SAFE implementation roadmap 
  * guide the transition from waterfall or ad-hoc agile (influenced by John Kotter!!! - great endorsement)
  * slightly dubious as it of course recommends certifications in more SAFE products everywhere
* The John Kotter bible - how to make change happen
  1. Establish a sense of urgency             - ice freezing in bottle
  2. Create a powerful guiding coalition      - get a leader with influence that can support your cause
  3. Develop the vision and strategy          - create a well easy to understand plan
  4. Communicate the vision                   - handle the nay sayers and repeat the message over and over
  5. Empower employees for broad-based action - allow an exploration mission where they may die and not come back
  6. Generate short-term wins                 - make sure those missions have a small achievable scope - finding new home 
  7. Consolidate gains and produce more wins  - get others to do exploration missions until it's the new norm
  8. Anchor new approaches in the culture     - every penguin is nomadic it's just a way of life now

**Keys to leading successful change** - just ignore, John Kotter did this much better (in above)
1. Management + leadership - get buy in from a leader for your cause
2. 'Have to' vs 'Want to' - identify those that want to create change in addition to their normal responsibilities
3. Head + Heart - appeal to a larger cause, values or purpose to win hearts and minds
4. Select few + diverse many - now inlist others uncovers leaders at all levels

**LACE** (lean agile centre of excellence) 
* team committed to delivering transformation improvements - Penguin time
* Use lean agile team mission statement (similar to lean business case)
  * for, who, the, is a, that, unlike, we
  * in scope, out of scope and success criteria
* Architects can contribute to LACE by becoming members or sync often and provide technical guidance


**Cool facts**
nothing will change unless you change the reward system - e.g. different KPIs

## Develop an action plan to support your organizationâ€™s transformation
sigh... this was a bit of a let-down - just a bunch of open-ended questions that refer to previous section content
* basically list your challenges and use those as a starting point
