# Aligning architecture with business value

## Role of architect

## Describe how Strategic Themes, portfolio canvas, and Portfolio Vision influence architecture
**Value streams: reminder**
* end to end delivery of value
* thing that can have bottlenecks
* actual value not just target 

**Strategic themes**
* differentiate business objectives from enterprise strategy
* drive portfolio differentiation and therefore innovation
* everything we do in SAFE traces back to strategic themes
* developed collaboratively with execs, LPM, EAs and Portfolio stakeholders
* Examples: obtain gold safety, increase sales by 15% etc... essentially OKRs

**Portfolio Canvas**
* describes structure and purpose of SAFE portfolio, kinda meta to portfolio
* how a portfolio creates/delivers and captures value for an organisation
* aligns value streams to goals of enterprise: valueStreams <= portfolio canvas (glue) => Enterprise goals
