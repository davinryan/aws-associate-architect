# Aligning architecture with business value

## Role of architect
* understand portfolio canvas and pull out relevant information - this is such a theme in SAFE....
* influence strategic themes, portfolio canvas and vision
* All architects - align operational and development value streams
* Solution architect - works with solution trains or development value streams
* System architect - works with an ART

## Describe how Strategic Themes, portfolio canvas, and Portfolio Vision influence architecture
**Value streams: reminder**
* end to end delivery of value (steps)
* thing that can have bottlenecks
* actual value not just target

**Strategic themes**
Ultimately the 'WHAT'
* differentiate business objectives from enterprise strategy
* drive portfolio differentiation and therefore innovation
* everything we do in SAFE traces back to strategic themes
* developed collaboratively with execs, LPM, EAs and Portfolio stakeholders
* Examples: obtain gold safety, increase sales by 15% etc... essentially OKRs

**Portfolio Canvas - portfolio current and future state**
Ultimately the 'HOW' - USED TO CREATE AND COMMUNICATE PORTFOLIO VISION
* Bi-directional relationship between portfolio (value streams) and enterprise strategy
  * enterprise strategy -> drives via strategic themes & portfolio budget -> portfolio
  * portfolio -> feedback via portfolio context (portfolio vision, guardrails, outcomes, flow, competency) -> enterprise strategy
* captures current and future state (vision) of portfolio
* describes structure and purpose of SAFE portfolio, kinda meta to portfolio
* how a portfolio creates/delivers and captures value for an organisation
* aligns value streams to goals of enterprise: valueStreams (portfolio) <= portfolio canvas (glue) => Enterprise goals
* one-page strategy that explains how we will execute against strategic themes: portfolio canvas (describes how to get to) => strategic themes 
* e.g. sections
  * Values steams
  * solutions
  * customer segments
  * channels
  * customer relationships
  * budget
  * KPIs/revenue
  * Key partners
  * Key activities
  * Key resources
  * Cost structure
  * Revenue streams

**Portfolio Vision**
Ultimately the 'WHY' for major decisions and align thinking across wide audience
* Owners: LPM and business owners
* creates alignment across wide range of stakeholders and workers
* aligns with strategic themes
* set direction of future work
* key decision support tool
* high level, expressed in terms of customer perspective
* covers old and new business
* what differentiates us from our competition
* e.g. exploring some opportunities in blah blah, while doing what we always do, we'll increase our gold, 
make us more market leading in blah blah and maybe give back to our communities

**Solution Vision**
Ultimately the 'WHY' for major decisions and align thinking across wide audience
* Owners: Solution and product management
* owners translate portfolio vision into solution vision

## Explain how Value Streams support the business
**Value Streams**
Ultimately the 'MACHINE THAT DELIVERS SOLUTIONS'
* define and realise portfolio level business objectives and organise ARTs to delivery more rapidly
* contain people that do the work
* make up a portfolio
* deliver value directly or support internal business process - ...sign again just 'everything really'
* 2 types
  * Development value streams - enablers that enable operational value streams (define, build, test, release)
  * Operational value streams - deliver value to customer (manage customer receive order, fulfill, dispatch, payment, support)
* Guide: 
  1. start with operational value stream and steps
  2. assign systems to operational value stream steps (may span more than one)
  4. assign development value stream across steps and systems that make sense to deliver solutions 
  e.g. autonomous delivery program covers steps receive order, fulfill, dispatch

## Explain how Solution Trains and Agile Release Trains deliver value
Ultimately we want to map solution ARTS to value streams

**Solution**
Ultimately the 'DELIVERABLE'
* value streams produce one or more solutions which are products or services or systems delivered to customer
* can be a product, product line or set of systems or service that enables operational stream/step ...sigh it's that everything thing again
* Value streams deliver solutions to customers (internal or external)

**ART - Agile release train**
Ultimately the 'SMALLER MACHINES THAT DELIVER A SOLUTION/S'
* org of 5 - 12 teams - 50 - 125 individuals
* self-contained, has all abilities to deliver
* deliver solution/s
* works in PIs
* aligned to mission/vision via art backlog

**Solution train - choo, choo**
Ultimately the 'WRAP THE ARTS (SOLUTIONS)'
* When do I need one: when solution crosses so many domains
* used in large solutions SAFE only
* co-ordinates, aligns ARTs and suppliers using Solution Vision, backlog, roadmap and PI
* suppliers treated as ARTs
* must map ARTS to individual solutions - do a diagram with coloured boxes :) 
  * e.g. ART1 = fleet solutions, ART2 = fulfillment and logistics, ART3 = Vehicle supplier
