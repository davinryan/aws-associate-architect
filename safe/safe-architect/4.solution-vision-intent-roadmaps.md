# Developing solution vision, intent and roadmaps

## Solution Vision
Provides a connection between the longer-term, aspirational 'what could be' and the 'what will likely be' that a 
solution or ART needs to accomplish over the next year. It reflects customer and stakeholder needs. It is
aspirational and sets boundaries and context for new features, NFRs and other work

* Elements of the vision are aspirational, not necessarily totally achievable. What we 'should' deliver, not what we 'will' deliver

## Solution Context
Solution context is where the solution is deployed, which is driven by how it will be used. Solution architecture 
is influenced heavily by solution context

* Solution context constrains all aspects of the solution
* Teams across all involved trains and suppliers will add context and detail to the solution intent
* Examples: Customer personas, existing infrastructure and ways our society works

## Solution Intent
Solution intent is a knowledge repository that is a record of decisions driving the solution. Favor models over documentation. 
Use minimum sufficient documentation. Keep solution intent collaborative and make decisions as late as possible. Document
items in a single place. High level supports change
* Keep it collaborative <-- so important!!! - do PRs, reviews etc...
* Records and communicates requirements, design, and system architecture decisions (ADRs)
* Facilitates continuous exploration and analysis activities (Architecture runway, NFRs, MVA)
* Aligns the customer, Development Team and Suppliers to a common purpose (vision)
* Supports compliance, contractual agreements, traceability, high assurance (regulatory and compliance)
* Collaborative effort between teams and program leadership (product management)
* Examples: Use-case, component and connector, sequence diagrams <- these are examples of models not documentation ... apparently!? 

## Moving from variable to fixed Solution Intent
* Fixed - things that are already built and hard to change, but we can get value from
* Variable - things that are not built yet, can result in more WIP until things are fixed
* Document fixed concepts. Avoid documenting concepts that are still variable

## Model-based systems engineering (MBSE)
* MBSE helps us with modeling to capture changing solution intent and context
* many cycles of Plan, do, check, adjust (explore alternatives and learn faster, consider compliance and impact analysis)
* Lean QMS 
  * USE: is an approach or system for safeguarding high assurance in a high-risk, compliance-driven environment
  * Practice (process)
    * Build the solution and compliance incrementally - don't do your compliance at the end when it's too late
    * Organize for value and compliance - ensure those responsible for compliance are part of value stream and make sure that Solution intent and backlogs reflect their concerns 
    * Build quality and compliance in - automated compliance tests or compliance as part of DoD
    * Continuously verify and validate (V&V) - do it every PI (cadence) 
    * Release validated solutions on demand - reduce last sign off to quick boring no-event 
* Accelerate learning before the cost of change gets too high
* Aligns with SAFE Principle 4

## NFRs
**Are constraints on the backlog**
* Architecture evolves to support NFRs
* Architects 'OWN' NFRs through their complete lifecycle (core competency of architects)
* Implementation should occur in a way that will allow several learning cycles to determine the right level of NFR
* Focus on fixed NFRs now and variable ones later
* Name/Scale(what/units)/Meter(method) -> (step 2) Constraint(worst)/Baseline(current)/Target(future)
* Automate compliance and NFR tests e.g.
  * performance requirement - like car breaking distance; 
  * regulatory requirement

**How to define**
* Bounded – When they lack bounded context, NFRs may be irrelevant and lead to significant additional work. For example, an airplane’s flight controls should be more rigid reliability than the infotainment system
* Independent – NFRs should be independent of each other so that they can be evaluated and tested without consideration of or impact from other system qualities
* Negotiable – Understanding NFR business drivers and bounded context mandates negotiability
* Testable – NFRs must be stated with objective, measurable, and testable criteria.

## Milestones
* Purpose - bring focus to the work, effective governance and better business outcomes
* 3 types
  * PI
    * Location: PI road maps and plans
    * objectively evaluate progress towards technical or business hypothesis
  * Fixed-date
    * Location: Everywhere but often distinct from development milestones
    * external events, market event/rhythm, third-party deliverable, external constraint
  * Learning
    * Location: Everywhere - more likely to be PI roadmaps
    * help validate business opportunities and hypothesis

## Road maps
* path to achieve a vision through scheduled events or milestones over a planning horizon (not same as investment horizon)
* Structure
  1. Portfolio roadmap aggregation of milestones/events over value streams (multi-year)
  2. Solution roadmap aggregation of milestones/events over ARTs for solution train (multi-year)
  3. PI roadmap (multi-PI 3-4)
  4. PI plan
  5. Iteration plan
  6. Daily plan
* Outer layers are less defined, less committed
* influenced by market behaviour
  * Market 'rhythms' are cyclical and predictable
  * Market 'events' are ad hoc
* Portfolio/solution roadmap planning horizons
  * have milestones/events along top
  * coarse grained view of epics on a timeline within each value stream or solution train
  * solutions are depicted as small boxes
  * 1st year planned in quarters which may or not align with PI boundaries
  * 2nd year done in 6month increments
  * 3rd and beyond planned in years
* PI roadmap planning horizons
  * PI increments
  * milestones along top
  * contains features and/or capabilities
* Current PI plan planning horizon
  * result of teams latest PI planning
  * committed/uncommitted objectives
  * risks

**Cool facts**
* an agile value is responding to change over following a plan. Responding to change, also states that there must be a plan

## Architectural runway
is working code and infrastructure, not the plan for it
* should be one of two PIs ahead of its use
* architects partner with delivery teams to build it
* Decentralise the effort to ensure runway evolves as needed
* Intentional architecture (just enough)- Specific guidelines produced by Architects that ensure the long-term 
performance and usability of Solutions
* Emergent design (Decentralised, trust teams with design decisions)- Process by which Agile Teams extend and 
improve the architecture as needed to support Feature delivery
* A balance between intentional architecture and emergent design is required for speed of development and
maintainability
