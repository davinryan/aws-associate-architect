## Why map your development value stream

**Development value streams**
* understand how work flows
* identify bottlenecks - theory of constraints
* contain all the activities, people, systems, information and material necessary to deliver value

**DevOps transformation canvas**
* Value stream
* Trigger - idea from business owners
* Demand rate - 20 per month
* First Step - feature definition
* Last Step - release to production
* Current/Future state metrics
  * Total process time - sum of all individual PT values
  * total lead tim - sum of all individual LT values
  * Activity ratio - Total process time / total lead time
  * Rolled % complete and accurate - (%C&A 1)*(%C&A 2)*(%C&A N)*100 - e.g. 32%
* Boundaries and limitations - e.g. architect for testability, lean startup
* Improvement items - e.g. feature toggles, lean startup, blue/green deployments

## How efficient is your development value stream?

* Lead time - time from 'ready for next step' to 'step complete'
* %C&A - percent of work that the next step can process as-is
* Process time - actual value-added work time
