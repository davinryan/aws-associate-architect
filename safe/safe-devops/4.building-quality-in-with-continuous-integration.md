## Develop the solution
Apply sound team and technical practices to implement high quality code

**Develop**
* Considerations
  * break features into stories - spikes, experiments
  * TDD
  * Version control - use pre-commit checks, automate for compliance. Put docs & Infra with code
  * engineering practices - test first, emergent design (arch sync), code reviews
  * Pair programming - share knowledge, risk and discover more options
  * Application telemetry - collect user-facing data not CPU/disk etc...; SLOs, Full stack log aggregation
  * Threat modeling

**SOLID** - so old-fashioned and mostly for OO

* The Single-responsibility principle: "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." In other words, every class should have only one responsibility
* The Openâ€“closed principle: "Software entities ... should be open for extension, but closed for modification."
* The Liskov substitution principle: "Functions that use pointers or references to base classes must be able to use objects of derived classes without knowing it." See also design by contract.
* The Interface segregation principle: "Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use."
* The Dependency inversion principle: "Depend upon abstractions, [not] concretions."

## Build continuously
Merge changes into the codebase, test the solution for built-in quality and package deployment artefacts

* Considerations
  * Continuous code integration - just CI and shifting left. SAFe talks about test packages. 
  Please do not use test packages. Try to have this stuff with the main code
  * build and test development - static code analysis, tests as part of the build, fast feedback (shift left)
  * trunk based development - Build in such a way that our software is always in a 'releaseable state'. Avoid long lived branches
  * gated commit - Broken codes doesn't stop the pipeline. Just the same as the above, fast feedback, shift left. 
  Build in quality instead of inspecting for it
  * application security - use tools to identify vulnerabilities - DevSecOps focus 

## Test end-to-end
Validate the solutions against acceptance criteria in a production like environment

* Considerations
  * Congruence between test and prod environments - make them the same as much as possible, use Infra as code to make it 
  easier to tear up/down environments and it easy to create consistency across environments; use virtualisation to keep 
  costs down; use immutable artefacts don't make prod the first environment to test in
  * Test automation - some tests are better suited to humans but the rest can be automated
  * Test data management - use prod grade data as close as possible, sync data regularly, use obfuscation, use version 
  control, use test data generators
  * Service virtualisation - Infra as code, use emulators or virtualisation, ability to tear up/down to facilitate faster testing
  * NFRs - constraints on backlog as acceptance criteria or Enablers to realise NFS, front load it, do not leave for 
  downstream testing when it's too expensive to fix

## Validate on a staging environment
Determine deployment readiness in a production-like environment

* Considerations
  * maintaining a staging environment - deploy to automatically when quality gates pass; make as production like as possible
  * Blue/Green deployment - Active/Passive (so bad, optimise for high risk deployments that come from large release 
  batch sizes) - Active/Active would be better combined with small regular deployments to production to reduce risk
  * system demo - feedback opportunity from stakeholders - entire system - see big picture
