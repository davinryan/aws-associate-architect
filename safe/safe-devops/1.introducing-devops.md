## The problem to be solved
* quickly validate the wants and needs of customers
* release features when customers need them

## The benefits of DevOps 
CALMR Values of focus
* automation
* lean flow

**DevOps Definition**
* DevOps is a mindset, a culture and a set of technical practices. It provides communication, integration, automation and close
cooperation among all the people needed to plan, develop, test, deploy, release and maintain a solution - basically Agile done right
* Dev - typically focuses on Flow
* Ops - typically focuses on stability
* Real goal: create flow with stability
  * All working together for speed and stability
  * Focus on aligning and syncing efforts to increase flow and quality
* Myth - flow doesn't come at the cost of quality because if we can increase flow we can respond faster to quality issues
* Avoid 'wall of confusion' between the Devs and Operations
* Essentially a community driven grassroots movement of, by and for practitioners

**3 ways of DevOps**
1. Flow/Systems thinking - optimise for flow
2. Amplify feedback loops
3. Culture of continual experimentation and learning

**Role of Safe**
Helps bridge gap between Agile and DevOps to help scale it

**Legacy environments**
* DevOps can work here too. Most stories come from updating or fixing brown-field solutions
* Our problems are different - Your not that special

## Continuous security and testing
* Role of continuous security - Security is everywhere and everyone's responsibility all along the pipeline
* Role of continuous testing - Built-in quality over inspect quality in

## SAFe's CALMR approach to DevOps

**CALMR approach**
* Culture - shared responsibility for dev, deploy, operations
* Automation - CI/CD, automate manual error prone steps, automate healthy processes
* Lean Flow - small batch sizes, limit WIP, extreme visibility, identify bottlenecks, manage & reduce queue lengths
* Measurement - measure flow (flow metrics), full stack telemetry (observability), information radiators
* Recovery - enable low risk releases (small batch right!) fast rollback or fast fix-forward, adopt a stop the line mentality
