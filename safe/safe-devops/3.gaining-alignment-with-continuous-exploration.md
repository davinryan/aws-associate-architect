## Create the solution hypothesis

**Continuous exploration**
* continually explore the market and user needs and define a vision, roadmap and set of features
that address those needs
* build alignment between stakeholders

**Hypothesise**
* We don't understand everything and need to validate our thinking
* Includes
  * lean start up thinking - MVP + test hypothesis
  * innovation accounting - MVP, tune the engine, pivot or persevere
  * leading indicators over vanity metrics

**Lean startup thinking**
1. identifying viability of ideas and PDCA (Plan-do-check-adjust) cycles
2. MVP - just enough to test assumptions
3. Hypothesis evaluation - if true, do more, if false pivot or stop working on Epic

**Innovation Accounting**
* Use metrics that will validate success or failure when defining an MVP
* Focus on metrics that demonstrate real customer engagement not vanity metrics
* Look for leading indicators to fail early

## Collaborate and research customer needs
Working with multiple stakeholders using elicitation techniques to better understand needs and ideas of the hypotheses we have.
e.g. Ops, infoSec, compliance, agile teams 

**Lean UX**
* Mindset, culture and process
* minimum viable increments
* measure against hypothesis
* breaks epics down into MMFs (minimum marketable feature - minimum feature set to delight a customer)
* CYCLE - Benefit hypothesis -> collaborative design -> build MMF -> evaluate
* focus away from pixel perfect - focus on just enough to satisfy

**Research**
Enough information to inform the Hypothesis

* Design thinking - personas, journey maps, empathy maps 
* Customer visits and Gemba walks - where the work is performed, devs can observe the business and customers using system
* Elicitation - interviews, surveys, competitive analysis, requirements workshops, use-case modeling
* Trade studies

## Architect the solution for continuous delivery

Do just enough architecture/work to move forward

* Considerations
  * architect for testability - if your system is too hard to test then your design is bad
  * separate deploy and release
  * architect for de-coupling deployment artefacts
  * architect for operations - production observability, full stack telemetry, fast recovery or fix-forward
  * threat modeling - essentially everyone is responsible for security. Get together and use personas or identify threats
  and ensure backlog reflects important security updates - produces NFRs

* Streamlets - dumb idea, just about grouping artefacts with similar roles in order to break up a large system or monolith
seriously just make artefacts independent. You do not need to group them

## Synthesise the vision, the roadmap and the ART backlog

* Considerations
  * Feature writing - Benefit hypothesis, acceptance criteria, NFRs
  * BDD - Gherkin syntax, collaborative scenario-first approach
  * Economic prioritisation - WSJF, job sequencing across PI
  * PI Planning
